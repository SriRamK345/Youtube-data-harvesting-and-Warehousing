# YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing using SQL, MongoDB and Streamlit

## Problem Statement
Create a Streamlit application that allows users to access and analyze data from multiple YouTube channels. The app should enable users to input a YouTube channel ID and retrieve relevant data using the Google API. Users can store data in MongoDB as a data lake, collect data for up to 10 YouTube channels, and migrate it to a SQL database. Querying the data warehouse with SQL and displaying the data in the Streamlit app.

# Technologies Used
